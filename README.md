# BlueText
Bluetext is a windows console chat app using the low level winsock2 library for bluetooth communication, made in c++.

## Motivation
I was motivated to make this because I was interested in learning c++. I have a bad habit of making up grand projects that may be a little too grand, but even if it isn’t perfect I definitely learned a lot from it.

## Structure
It’s designed in a single thread manner, with a contineous loop that handles interaction and updates the ‘UI’ where needed.
